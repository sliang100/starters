# Starters
Starter files for Linux

```
git https://github.com/zxlin/starters.git
```

Make sure you have `zsh` and `pip3` installed first, then inspect the settings to make sure you don't want to change anything.
To install all the files, run 
```
./setup
```

This will change your default shell to `zsh` instead of `bash` that ships with most systems. 

Tested on latest Ubuntu and MacOS.
